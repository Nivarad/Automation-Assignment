# Automation-Assignment
Automation assignment that was asked by SecuriThings

It was the first time I used Selenium and TestNG so it was really fun and educative making this assignment.

Some added features I implemeneted :

1. A system that detects an unused email for user creation 
2. A system that can detects and add to cart items that are defined by key words , like dress or shirt.
3. File system that copies the further instructions message a user recieves in the end of the purchase.


also I implented the code with a Page Object design and Page Factory which were really cool concepts.
